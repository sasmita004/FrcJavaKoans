     * All lines of code in Java must end with the ';' character. Ex:

     * 
     * In Java, you can compute arithmetic expressions in Java. For example:

     *      3 * 4
     *      3 / 4
     *      3 - 4
     * 
     * You can use the method System.out.println([some arithmetic expression]) to do so.

     * # Creating a variable to store a value
     * 
     * Compute 2 + 2 and store the value in a variable. Display the value of the variable.
     * 
     * ---------   TIPS --------------
     * 
     * A variable is a piece of information with a name. We can get the value by using its name.
     * So, to declare a variable, you need to give it a name and a value.
     * But in Java, you also need to give the kind of information (its type).
     * For example, when the information is an integer number, the type is called 'int'.
     * Putting everything together, if we want to create a variable for the number of legs of a pig:
     * 
     *      int pigNbOfLegs = 4;
     *       ^       ^        ^
     *      type   name     value
     * 
     * The value can also be an arithmetic expression. For example:
     * 
     *      int pigNbOfLegs = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1;
     * 
     * Whenever you use the name of the variable, Java will replace the name with the variable's value when running.
     * For example, if you want to display the variable defined above:
     * 
     *      System.out.println(pigNbOfLegs);
     *                              ^
     *          'pigNbOfLegs' will be replaced by the variable's value.
     * 
     * So this is equivalent to (because the variable's value is 4):
     * 
     *      System.out.println(4);
     *

     * 
     * ---------   TIPS --------------
     * 
     * You can read a text from the console with readLine(). This method is _returning_ the value typed in the console by the user.
     * 'Returning a result' means Java will replace the call to the method by its returned result in the code.
     * 
     * Let's say that when asked, the user will type 'Hello' then the [ENTER] key in the console. Then:
     * 
     *     String someText = readLine();
     *                             ^
     *       this method call will be replaced by its result

    /**

     * 
     * ---------   TIPS --------------
     * 
     * You will need to create a text out of 2 text values. Glueing multiple text values together is called 'concatenating'.
     * In Java, you can do that with the '+' operator:
     * 
     *     String glued = "abc" + "def";
     *               ^
     *       glued's value is "abcdef"
     * 
     * Warning! Don't confuse the String concatenation operator with the number's 'addition' operator. This won't work:
     * 
     *     4 + "abc"
     *       ^
     *     Error: because the left of the operator is a number, '+' is the 'addition' operator for numbers, not the text's 'concatenate' one.
     *     As a result, Java expects an other number to the right of the '+', but "abc" is not a number.
     * 
     * Note: however, this will work:
     * 
     *     String glued = "abc" + 4;
     *               ^
     *       glued's value is "abc4"
     * 
     * This is because Java can convert anything, including numbers, to text automatically. So in this case, it is equivalent to:
     * 
     *     String glued = "abc" + "4";
     *                              ^
     *                 Automatically converted to text

     * 
     * You can concatenate more than 2 texts together. For example:
     *

     *               ^

     * ---------   TIPS --------------
     * 
     * The trick is, the value returned from the console is always text.
     * As a result, in order to compute the 5-years-from-now value, you will need to convert the text to an integer number first.
     * You can convert some text to an integer like so:
     * 
     *      String nbOfOrangesAsText = "3";
     *      int nbOfOrangesAsNumber = Integer.parseInt(nbOfOrangesAsText);
     *                   ^
     *         value is 3, as a number
     * 
     * For the computation, you can either create a new variable you can display later:
     * 
     *     int nbOfOragesAfterIAteOne = nbOfOrangesAsNumber - 1;
     * 
     * Or compute it directly where you need it, by using parentheses:
     * 
     *     System.out.println("Oranges left: " + (nbOfOrangesAsNumber - 1));
     *
